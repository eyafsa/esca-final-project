        <h2>For Normal / Dry skin: CeraVe Facial Cleanser</h2>
        <!--ADD DESCRIPTION HERE-->
        <p> The CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser is on of the most popular facial cleaners 
            in the skin care community right now. It is perfect for anyone with a normal to dry skin type.
              Many moisturizers have the ability to make the skin feel dry and tight after washing, 
              but this one does the opposite.  It leaves your skin feeling clean without the stripping
               feeling.  Its smooth formula contains helpful ingredients like hyaluronic acid which helps 
               the skin stay hydrated and healthy, as well as multiple different types of ceramides that 
               assist with locking in the moisture in the skin.  This gentle cleanser is the perfect 
               starter for those who want to stay within their budget and also have healthy glowing skin.

        <h2>For Oily / Combination skin: Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser Facial Cleanser</h2>
        <!--ADD DESCRIPTION HERE-->
        <p>  This cleanser is one of my favorites.  Using this makes my face feel squeaky clean and oil free.
              It's perfect with those who suffer with oily skin, as it delays the act of oils emerging from 
              the skin.  The use of the low pH levels in this cleanser helps with the balance of oil and water
              within the skin, so it stays property hydrated.   It also includes tea tree oil which helps with
               uneven skin tone as it refreshens and brightens the skin.  Not to mention, the earthy tea tree
                smell definitely wakes you up!
